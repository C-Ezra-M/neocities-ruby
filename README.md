# The Neocities Gem

A CLI and library for using the Neocities API. Makes it easy to quickly upload, push, delete, and list your Neocities site.

## Installation

If you're using OSX (or already have ruby installed), run this command:

    gem install neocities

After that, you are all set! Run `neocities` to see the options and get started.

## Neocities::Client

This gem also ships with Neocities::Client, which you can use to write code that interfaces with the Neocities API.
